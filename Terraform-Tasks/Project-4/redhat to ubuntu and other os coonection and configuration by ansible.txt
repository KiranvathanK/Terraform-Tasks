Already ansible installed by using userdata file(ansible.sh)
login to ansible server

	- ansible --version

update target machine ip inside the ansible host folder

	- sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

inside host file updat public ip of target machines

[ubuntu]
3.10.12.196

now target machine need to connect with ansible server

login to target machine is ubuntu in our case

	- sudo apt-get update 

change to root user

	- sudo su -

create a new user AND give password to that

	- sudo adduser <username>
	- sudo passwd <username>

for password should not expires for that use below command

	- passwd -x -1 target-1 (if need not mandtory)

change to the created user
	- su - target-1

	- pwd(to check present directory)

	- ll (to check list of files folders permission details)

genrate new ssh key(inside target mschines)

	- ssh-keygen(enter upto create a key)

(it will give some error so better give root privilage)

	- sudo visudo

	- %target-1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL     (edit inside)

go to ansible server 
create new user

	- sudo adduser <username>
	
	- sudo passwd <username>

genrate new ssh key(inside ansible(master) machine)

	- ssh-keygen(enter upto create a key)

copy the public key and paste in authorized_keys of target machine (target1)
	
	- sudo vi authorized_keys (paste the public key copied from ansible server id_rsa.pub)

change owner so first change user to ansibleserver

	- su - ansibleserver

	- chown ansibleserver:ansibleserver /etc/ansible

error occurs

so go back to rootuser - exit

[root]$ chown ansibleserver:ansibleserver /etc/ansible

now again go to new added user(ansibleserver)
	- su - ansibleserver
	- cd /etc/ansible

connection from ansible server to target machines

	- ansible -m ping ubuntu@<public ip>

now permission denied error comes

so we have to go to target-1 machine (make sure we are inside of .ssh folder)
give permission to authorized key

	- chmod 600 authorized_keys

now goto ansible server and check connect once again 

	- ansible -m ping ubuntu@<public ip>

login success from ansible server to target machine 

logout from target machine
	- exit

so modify in host file:

	- cd /etc/ansible/hosts

	- target-1(name of hosts) ansible_ssh_host=<pub ip of target machines> 

to check connection

	- ansible target-1 -m ping

if grouped

	- ansible servers -m ping

now create one yaml file inside ansible folder

	- vi install_nginx.yaml

paste this yaml code

---
- hosts: target-1,target-2
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: update
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt: name=nginx state=latest


      notify:
        - restart nginx

  handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
      service: name=nginx state=reloaded

- hosts: target-3,target-4
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  tasks:

  - name: Basically "yum"
    yum:
      update_cache: yes

  - name: Install NGINX Packages
    yum:
      name: nginx
      state: latest

  - name: Start Service
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
      enabled: yes

to run yaml file

	- ansible-playbook install_nginx.yaml -v

now we got error

**********************************************ERrOR
*
fatal: [34.207.194.161]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Missing sudo password"}
fatal: [54.91.132.178]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Missing sudo password"}

******************************************************
so we have to give sudo privilage to host(target nodes)
come out from user to root user
	- sudo visudo

edit inside the file

%target-1 ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL <example shown inside that file only>

now run yaml file

	- ansible-playbook install_nginx.yaml -v
